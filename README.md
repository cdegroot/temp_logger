A project to build a temperature logger using:

- Stand-alone ATmega8
- NTC probe
- An RTC chip (MCP7940N)
- Some flash memory

Work in progress. Ignore.

The goal is to have a temperature logger that can take a sample each 5 minutes or so for months on 
batteries. If I ever finish it, I'm going to use it to keep track of homebrew fermentation
temperatures :)
